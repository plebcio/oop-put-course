# A version of the project without expections - Possible improvment

Instead of exceptions 'evaluate' returns Double.NaN
and raises the hadError flag accessible through 'hadError()'.
The message is then accessed through 'errorStr()' method .

<sub><sup>This isn't in the main project because exceptions were required</sup></sub>
